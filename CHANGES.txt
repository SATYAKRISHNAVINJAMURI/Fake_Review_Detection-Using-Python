All the basic principles of python were followed.
All the indentation errors were fixed.
The IOError is now rectified by adding a resource directory as a package and using package_resource module.
Redundant code was removed as suggested.
Reason behind using several String Comparisions:
	a) As this project is completely based on reading DataSet files, and extracting useful information out of it,
	   a lot of string comparisions should be made to filter useful data.
	b) File Sentiword.net in the resources folder is the base file for finding the sentiment score of a review. We
	   basically get all words into a dictionary (__dict) when a first object was created and use it for calculating
	   rating for several other reviews.

How to run the program.
	a) Download the DataSet file from the link give in the README.txt
	b) You can follow the instructions in the README.txt file.
